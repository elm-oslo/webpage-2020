### [March 11 2020]
Oslo Elm Days is unfortunately postponed due to the ongoing situation with the Coronavirus.

For now, just know that we really want there to be a new Oslo Elm Days, but that we cannot say whether weâ€™ll be able to make it happen in 2020 or will have to wait until 2021.

We are working on figuring out how to proceed, and will post new information here and on Twitter ([@osloelmdays](https://twitter.com/osloelmdays)) as soon as something is decided!
